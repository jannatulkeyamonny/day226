The project visualizes the idea of a revolutionary navigation tool for the visually impaired people. This ordinary looking blind stick is actually extra ordinary it has been provided with different kind of sensors to give the person an idea about the vicinity in which he or she is present and make the individual much more aware. The GPS sensor has been designed and programmed in such a manner that is it is able to give an idea about the best possible route depending upon the location it is able to access. The user has been provided with the phenomenal feature of choosing locations from the set of destinations that have been stored in the database of the system. In this stick ultrasonic sensor GPS and GSM tracker, ESP 8266, water sensor, infrared sensor and RF sensor, battery have been used. the comprehensive goal of the device is to provide a much more comfortable and Secure method for the visually impaired people to overcome hindrances in daily life.</p>

                        <p>This article introduces a solar grid-tie integrated (GTI) Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station with high-frequency-link (HFL) Full-Bridge Photovoltaic Converter (FBPC). Due to its ease of use and low cost, a rectifier running at line frequency with a step-down transformer is the most popular method for charging three-wheeler electric vehicle (TWEV). It is not possible to regulate the output voltage or current using this conventional charging system which leads to inconsistent and inefficient battery charging, overcharging, overheating, energy waste and degrading battery life over time. On the other hand, the solar-grid interface can ensure maximum power generation and exchange throughout the system. To exchange the power to and from the utility grid, the design and development of a high-frequency H-bridge DC-DC converter-based photovoltaic (PV) charging solution with integrated GTI is presented in this paper. Various operational scenarios were examined through calculations and performance were analyzed via a hardware prototype with a PV array to confirm the viability of the proposed system.</p>

                    <h2>Battery Charger for Electrical Vehicle with Push-Pull Converter</h2>
                    <p>This paper reports on the AC-DC conversion process of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs). The suggested architecture of the converter is focused on the AC-DC converter of the H-bridge rectifier and then boosts the Dc voltage. This boosts the reliability of the converter since only a fraction of the power travels into the converter, thus improving
                        its efficiency and then use a push-pull converter for the
                        conversion of DC to AC and stepping it down by flyback
                        transformer and then rectified the AC voltage to get the pure
                        required DC. For charging of an EV battery, demonstrations of
                        the actions of the suggested conversions of voltage and PWM
                        control of the MOSFET of the boost converter and push-pull
                        converter by PIC16f690 microcontroller are described. The
                        positive response of the suggested method is demonstrated by
                        the results. It is checked that only a fraction of the power factor
                        of about 96% is processed by the proposed converter for the
                        overall power output spectrum.</p>
